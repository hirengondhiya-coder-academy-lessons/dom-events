# Warning!

In index.html, there is a div with id `warning` and a button with id `makeItRed`.

Your task is to make the background of the the warning div red when the button is clicked. Add node to the script.js file to do this.

_Hint_: You can set style directly on a DOM node using the style property. For example:

ele.style.color = "blue"

where ele is a node in the DOM.
